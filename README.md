# TickyTacky
A Javascript Tic Tac Toe game with simple computer AI to play against.

This project started as a challenge to myself to see how I would do under "coding in the dark" style restrictions. I didn't limit myself by time, but I was not allowed to run the app until I thought it was 'done'. It wasn't too bad, there were plenty of mistakes but it was a culmination of small errors so there was no major rewritting to get the app to actually work.

The master branch is the final version after I fixed all my little mistakes.
